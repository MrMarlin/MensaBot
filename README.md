Telegram Polling Bot for Food decisions at HSR Rapperswil

<h1>Description</h1>
This bot fetches the daily menus for the 'Mensa' and 'Forschungszentrum' at 
HSR Rapperswil and puts them in a poll. This makes it for groups of students
easier to decide where to eat. 

<h1>Why MensaBot?</h1>
Our small group of befriended Students at HSR needed to decide where to eat
lunch. Because we're not always in the same class or at class at all, there
was a need for a simple and centralized solution. This is how the idea for 
Mensabot was born. A bot, that sends a poll with the daily menus. Everybody
who is in  the Telegram group can vote and by lunch it is decided where to
eat.
